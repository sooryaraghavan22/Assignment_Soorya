    "2) What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. You can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable.\n",
    "    \n",

    "Variable as an identifier to store a value in a memory location and to manipulate it if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10 \n",
    "x = 20 \n",
    "So, in the above example, we can say that x is a variable that stores the value 10. Interestingly, in Python, there is no specific command to declare a variable. Therefore, a variable is created when you first assign a value to it in your program. Thus, in the above program, the variable x is created when you assign the value 10 to it, meaning that a memory address is allocated to store the value 10. Later, when you re-assign using x = 20, the value in the corresponding memory address will be changed to 20. Thus, you can think of variable as an identifier to play around with a value that is created and stored in a memory location. A variable can be of several types like integer, string, float, etc. based on the value you assign to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings:-\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as Python is concerned, anything you assign to a variable using quotes (single or double) will be considered as a string. Thus, a string is one of several types of a variable.\n",

    "a = 10 \n",
    "b = 20 \n",
    "print(a+b)  #prints 30 \n",
    "So, in the above example, (a+b) returns 1020 in the first case (string concatenation of 10 and 20), whereas in the second case, it returns 30 since it interprets a and b as integers at run-time. You can cross check the type of a variable x by using the command type(x).\n",
